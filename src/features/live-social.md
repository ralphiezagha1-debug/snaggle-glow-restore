## API Integration

### Data Contracts
All API clients are typed and located in `src/lib/api/`:

```typescript
// Live Auctions
GET /auctions/live|ending|upcoming
GET /auctions/:id
POST /auctions/:id/bid
POST /auctions/:id/chat
POST /auctions/:id/shareWin

// Social
GET /users/:id/profile
POST /users/:id/follow
DELETE /users/:id/follow
GET /feed
POST /listings/relist

// Gamification
GET /leaderboards
GET /challenges
GET /achievements
```

### Mock System
Toggle between mock and live data via environment variable:
```typescript
const API_MODE = process.env.VITE_API_MODE || 'mock';
```

Mock data factories in `src/mocks/` provide realistic test data for all features.

## Design System Updates

```

### TypeScript Standards
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types without justification
- Comprehensive interface definitions
- Generic type utilization where appropriate

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Mock API integration tests
- E2E testing for critical user flows

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: All required packages are already included
2. **Environment Setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
3. **Start Development**: `npm run dev`
4. **Switch API Mode**: Set `VITE_API_MODE=live` when backend is ready
